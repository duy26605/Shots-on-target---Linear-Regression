# Shots-on-target-Linear-Regression
This project analyzes a data set on all time Premier League soccer playersâ€™ statistics with the purpose of developing a linear regression model that can predict the number of shots on target from various features of Premier League Players. The features include position, age, number of times hitting woodwork, number of big chances missed, number of interception, number of recoveries, number of aerial battle won, number of assists, and number of passes per match. We found that we can predict the square root of shots on target with the adjusted R^2 = 0.9398, and the residual standard error is 0.7751 square root shots on target. The significant predictors are Age, Hit woodwork, Big chances missed, Interceptions, Recoveries, Assists, and Shots on target.
We discover that older soccer player with more number of hit woodwork, big chances missed, recoveries, assists, and less number of interceptions tends to have a higher number of shots on target. We also found 8 interaction effects, being: one between age and big chances missed, one between age and interceptions, one between age and recoveries, one between hit woodwork and big chances missed, one between hit woodwork and interceptions, oen between big chances missed and interceptions, one between interceptions and assists, and one between recoveries and assists.
